I too imbibed this values in due course of time.\r\nMy story about E/// core values is from one of my assignment with Digicel Martinique (A carribean island) for system live upgrade. Due to some reasons, a task that was suppose to be completed in couple of weeks time has actually taken 4 months to deliver. \r\nWhen I get this opportunity in first week of June, I had enormous responsibility of gaining customer confidence and also instilling faith of customer in E/// Global delivery model. \r\nIf I capture my experience in terms of E/// code values, it goes like:\r\nProfessionalism\r\nI collected as much as information from previous engineer, line management, design unit, CPM and also from customer. My whole objective was to identify the gaps and start working on same. Before starting the actual work I wanted to gain confidence of customer and E/// project manager as region was not ready to take this up unless we have chance of ~100% success.\r\nAs a professional consultant, I did the analysis, take references, analyse customer IT environment and ask as many question as possible to reach a point where I am sure that root cause of previous failure is pretty clear to everyone and next execution will not fail.\r\nRespect\r\nIn due course of time I developed a good rapport and gain their confidence about successful execution. Prepared details solution strategy with clearly mentionedc time-line of deliverables and fall-back approach with minimum impact. This has helped me in gain customer confidence and also reflection of my understanding of customer problem and pain areas.\r\nPerseverance\r\nI had faced different kind of problems in information gathering, strict time-line and travel related issues. But all this while my focus was on gain customer confidence. Putting faith of people involved in our global delivery model. My previous experience and faith shown by people around me has been really helpful. In my professional journey this was first moment when most of us were not sure about outcome but I was sure about it. Finally when I did it successfully, it was one such moment that one cherish throughout their life.\r\nI am glad that I share this with you all and may be it will inspire someone to  have his faith in E/// values. I would like to conclude this story with following\r\nexerpt from this journey:\r\n\"Thanks Amit for your great support and recover back customer confidence in our global delivery Capabilities as Ericsson.

I can do things in a right way.

Hearing this, I got to know how big this event is going to be. Again, a bit thrilled if I would be able to make up my part properly & as expected…\r\nThough things were prepared; however we all worked over the weekend again and again refining things for it to look better in front of the customer.\r\nFinal Day has arrived. The event started with introductions. Later we entered a Giant Conference Room wherein we started presenting. Things were moving well until the discussion started happening around BSS Transformation. Everyone had their own thoughts on such Transformations; hence the discussion got stretched and became a little Hot too. After a while, the discussions happening around were started going all above my head. I was trying hard coping up with the vocabulary and even on the technicality. It was like hearing some foreign language and trying to catch up at-least few words that might have been said in English.\r\nFinally the meeting got over and everyone looked satisfied including customer. Everyone had a good & relaxing time that evening. We hit the best restaurant in that town and I happened to get familiar with many of the Ericsson Staff in person. Regardless of individual’s positions within the Organization, we all were just enjoying ourselves gossiping around. Many of us including myself flew next morning back to their home destinations.\r\n\r\nThis was the event which thrilled me, excited me, inspired me in many which ways. I started thinking myself, If I am satisfied with my current work profile and started comparing it with what happened in Bangkok. I made my decision and started working towards it.

The philosophy of this organization is imprinted on everything Modi does or doesn’t. He pursued an itinerant life travelling from ashram to ashram, leaving behind his child bride Jashodaben. He joined RSS once again & found time to earn his Masters in Political Science. Modi went into hiding disguised as a Sikh when RSS was banned in the Emergency years 1975-77. He was made the general secretary of the Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti. During this period he wrote a book titled Sangharsh ma Gujarat (Gujarat\'s struggle). Modi rose to prominence after organising Murli Manohar Joshi\'s Kanyakumari-Srinagar Ekta yatra in 1991.In 1988, Modi was elected as organising secretary of BJP\'s Gujarat unit. Modi declined an offer to be Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel\'s deputy chief minister, informing Advani and Vajpayee that he was going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all, and on 7 October 2001, Modi was appointed the Chief Minister of Gujarat, when Keshubhai fell ill. As Chief Minister, Modi\'s ideas of governance revolved around privatisation & small government. Then in 2002 the Gujarat riots happened, where 2000 lives were lost. Human Rights organizations world over held Modi responsible. Despite these allegations he became CM 3 more times till he resigned to become India’s PM in 2014.

My values are quite outspoken in the way I do my work and determination to achieve and deliver keeps me going. I was single handedly managing all the workshops for three different project areas; therefore it was difficult to note everything in workshops. There were three parallel activities my workshop demanded: questioning, listening and writing. To gain customer’s confidence it is important that he feels that he is being listened, therefore I opted for listening and asking. I used sound recorder on phone and flip chart to record our discussions. It was little difficult when I started with this approach as I had to invest double time to fetch useful information from the discussion. This activity took away my nights and weekends. Customer was really impressed that how could I capture all the information in my notes when I was not writing in the workshops. They also found my notes useful and for me it was making wonders as I was able to make agenda for my next workshops.\r\nI was given a feedback by customer that “I have been impressed with Kirti\'s ability to cope with huge amounts of change, data and stakeholders in this extremely complex environment in the program and to cope with the ambiguous nature of many of the deliverables.\" This feedback said all and I feel that I lived Ericsson Value &#61514;\r\nPROFESSIONALISM: I am neat, organized and diligent worker. I like things to go in a process oriented way with no backlogs and delays. Therefore I always adopt a planned approach to carry on my work. \r\n“First Impression is Last Impression” is a very well said statement and it means a lot in our professional world. It is important to act professionally, make good customer relationship and leave a long lasting impact by your work. Professionalism is not only how we do our work, it also includes business etiquettes, dressing and adopting the culture.\r\nWith my professional approach, I not only lived Ericsson value but gained appreciation from my Regional Manager and an opportunity to work in next phase of same project.\r\nRESPECT: For me the most important value is RESPECT. It is hard to earn respect from your peers and customers in the short duration of 2 months. It is important to respect the sentiments of our customers, respect their language and culture. My 2 months of interaction with Croatian customers not only gave me professional growth but fostered new relations.

Though the Journey started with little Ups and Downs, I managed to with stand and made a strong come back.

We maintained 100% SLA every month and achieved \"Best Team Award\" for the year 2014-15. Not only technical part, we are also given training on “Business Ethics and Cross Cultural Program\".

We used to come is three shifts daily.  Sometimes we may be pushed into a position, where nobody will be able to take leave. At that time, if someone in the team is in need of leave, due to personal reasons or Sickness or emergency, remaining people will extend and cover his shift. This shows the respect/helping tendency towards the other colleagues. This will create a good bonding in the work environment. We respect each individual\'s hard work and efforts put in the team and recognize it every quarter by awarding \"Rock Star Awards\". I would say this as an example to the value \"Respect\".\r\n\r\nI would proudly say that, by following the keys values of Ericsson \"Professionalism, Respect and Perseverance”, I have achieved the \"Best Employee of the year 2014-15 Award\" in Cricket Project.','','','','','','',NULL,NULL,70,'EGANVAI',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-11 09:40:01','Pending'),('EYACDEL','rajesh.kumar.r.singh@ericsson.com','KOLKATA','EBICHAK','BUGS GSI M&A Adaptn Serv Appln CA',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,71,'ERANSIR',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-07 04:15:03','Pending'),('EPRIPRA','priya.pradhan@ericsson.com','BANGALORE','EANVSIA','BUGS GSI BSS EMA-CADE Adaptn 3',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,72,'EAADMAD',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-07 05:33:16','Pending'),('EDEBOSE','debojyoti.sengupta@ericsson.com','Kolkata','ECHAKSO','BUGS GSI OSS CM DM KOL 7','I am working in Ericsson Since Oct-2009.

But my personal opinion would be, Professionalism is a combination of factors such as putting the CUSTOMER first ,adhering to our COMMITMENTS, display our COMPETENCE level, DEDICATION to our job and taking the LEADERSHIP most importantly. When I joined Ericsson, I have a chance to work on Networked Society domain and MSDP. It was entirely new to me and without any initial transition, I had started working on ATT Connected Car project. Had gone through various ebooks to know about it and tried to improve my competence level in the particular domain working throughout day and night. I had took the ownership too.Since I have putting my customer first, I have been putting extra efforts to deliver my implementation. As a result of my professionalism , I was recognized SSA Award in Ericsson and that was my greatest gift in my career.','Respect is one of the human quality that everyone must have . I have experienced one with respect and without it. I could feel huge difference in Ericsson when I compare with my ex company. Being a woman I would say, WOMEN are most respected and well treated by all MEN in ericsson. Apart from that,  the way my superior treats people with courtesy, politeness and kindness really making me speechless. Not only my superior, all RNAM guys and other colleagues encourage co-workers to express their opinions and ideas irrespective of the gender,race and religion. I have been given full freedom to use my ideas to improve my work that gives me a greater satisfaction in me. And all employees are greatly rewarded for their extra ordinary performance and their hard efforts. Even though employees put their utmost efforts with professionalism and perseverance, but if their work is not respected, then obvioulsy employees would opt for a change. But ERICSSON is not giving such kind of room for it.','In my personal opinon ,with extraordinary perseverance , anything can be achieved. Never give up the confidence for anything to succeed. In my ATT CVC project, when everything looks greek and latin to me, only with my perseverance, I gained knowledge about Networked Society/MSDP domain. In MSDP, we have our own Application Programming Interface and so it was really difficult to understand the concepts and implementation which nobody could help me out by that time. The deadline was almost near but I never give up to complete the complicated module. I failed in my implementation for the first 2 days but I have only SUCCESS factor running  in my mind, worked hard day and night , committed towards it, explored new avenues  to achieve it.

Being a fresher, my friends shared their experiences of the corporate culture (as and when they used to get goodies and other incentives) and I used to compare those with my organization. Truly speaking, I always had an enviousness for that and often used to refer the same during my discussions about how the job and work is going.\r\nOne day, after going back from work I was deprecating about the same to my mother. She simply smiled and pointed to my badge (LIVE, LOVE ERICSSON) which I was wearing and simply said Ericsson gave you a chance to live – “ERICSSON”. She quoted – “Anything that cannot be valued, doesn’t mean that it’s not important.” This statement of hers was a point-blank for me. It morphed my thoughts process in real terms. That moment, I actually realized that the experiences and values stay with you forever. It genuinely, makes an imprint on your character for lifetime which materialized goodies can never have impact on.\r\nDestiny had so much to offer and co-incidentally my mother suffered a severe heart-attack a month later. As being said “The genius of leadership is its humanness and heart “, Leadership team stood beside me in one of the toughest times of my life. They gave me the freedom to complete my assignment keeping my family at priority. I actually felt blessed that they helped me maintain balance between professional and personal life. In real sense, they taught me “to respect” by respecting my necessity & responsibility towards my family.

The customer refuted both metrics as being inappropriate against a CAPEX limitation.\r\nI attempted to alleviate the concern by drawing upon the process diligence and promised to come up with an objective response to the reported inappropriateness of the proposal. Faced with the dual challenge of questioning the trust and professionalism of major stakeholders in the process, viz., the development and the infrastructure experts respectively, I approached them with the request to understand whether there was room for improvement in our proposal with all the professionalism that I could muster.\r\nI approached the developer with sincere respect of her experience to review the proposal critically with only the mandate that she might have considered an effort that may not be required to be expended but considered only as part of standard approaches.\r\nI also appealed to the technical architect to review if the augmentation proposed could absolutely be tied to the new requirement or was rather in line with general capacity augmentation required as part of standard operating procedures.\r\nThe results were beyond my expectations. The development expert responded with a significant reduction in effort noting that there had been inadvertent inclusion of components due to standard templates in the estimation tool. The technology expert responded by saying that the diligence had indicated that although the current proposal was correct, a related domain had corrected an erroneous CAPEX order that was inappropriately raised due to a miscalculation of capacity consumption against the systems concerned. The result was welcomed by the customer as they saved money directly and indirectly due to our collective persistence on the concern.\r\nIf I am any judge of outcomes of behavioural exertions, I can say that this situation reinforced in me the strengths of these character traits - respect, professionalism and perseverance. I have learned that these cannot be exercised in isolation or mutual exclusion and as we feel we mature, we actually become practitioners of these qualities in ourselves and our fellow humans.\r\n','','','','','','',NULL,NULL,220,'EAADMAD',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-11 11:21:31','Pending'),('EKKKMMM','karthik.m@ericsson.com','Guindy Chennai','ETHANGA','BUGS GSI CS AIR SDP VS 3','','','','The success story which want to explain here is, Challenging experience which i have faced in my latest project which was Vodafone IN modernization project.It is basically an Rednee IN to Ericsson IN migration and also happened first time in India.I was the part of Business configuration team.

This was really a tough time because it was a huge dump with multiple files and also we were having very limited duration for the migration date.Then we had some internal meeting and made plan to way forward.To give a respect on customer words and build the customer trust , we have agreed to take input from dump with some conditions.By showing our professionalism and perserverance , finally we have derived the specified input from the dump which is required for Ericsson Business configurtion by conducting multiple workshop with customer to understand the dump and internally developed the tool to covert the dump into required specified format.\r\n\r\n   And Finally We have completed all the Business configuration in Ericsson Charging system using that Input sheet in very short span of time and successfully migrated the subscribers from Rednee IN system to Ericsson Charging system on same planned date without any delay and It was really called as Flawless migration eventhough we have faced lot of issues in demo migration but solved all the issues before the final migration with our perservance and also very well apreciated by the customer beacuse of the Exceptional performance, team work, perseverance and technical skills demonstrated.

Professionalism is, rather, a set of internalized character strengths and values directed toward high quality service to others through one\'s work. Here in Ericsson we work towards the betterment of self as well as others, directly or indirectly: clients, customers, employers, colleagues. Thus we are both task-oriented and people-oriented. In Ericsson we have the opportunity and an ongoing need to learn and improve, to master traditional approaches and then try to improve on them. I learnt here more on how to concentrate mind and will on the tasks to work quickly but not hurriedly, careful but not slow termed as \"Fast and Flawless\". Respect and perseverance keeps us going and achieving the defined goals of professionalism. Whatever I have learnt, I got the opportunity to deliver in one of the project, \"Bharti Airtel India\". This is one of the most crucial projects for Ericsson. I had the dedication and will to deliver my best and that is what was expected too. Sometimes customers have unrealistic deadlines and we have to deliver within timeline. There was a lot of pressure for on-time deliverable of the project and it had crucial issues. I managed to fix the issues and it couldn\'t have been possible without dedication and perseverance. I knew what was needed and how it was supposed to be achieved. There were multiple SDP\'s which needs to be installed and Go Live within 30 days of span. Head of the project has already committed to deliver the same and now the pressure was on us. We (Team mates including me) being new to the Ericsson were first trembled about the upcoming situation. But the moral support and encouragement shown by the complete team made us feel a bit comfortable. We kick start the work helping each other parallely.We started working as per the plan which called for extra effort and time out from the personal life. We kept ourselves boosted for the upcoming work, even when we had so many sleepless nights. Finally the existing issues were resolved and project fall on place and we moved ahead.

Solution document was designed after analyzing and capturing the requirements and was delivered to the customer. \r\nThe Solution integrators from GSI travelled to Ireland and installed the IVR with a very basic configuration and complex requirements were awaited from Design unit as Product customization.\r\nThere was a long gap that occurred because of Region/DesignUnit communication regarding the cost of PC along with the resource management and the project was no-where meeting the deadlines.\r\nLot of Solution Integrator\'s from IVR team joined the project for its accomplishment but there was lack of communication in handover among the GSI resources. The node went live without cross verifying the configuration and errors that might occur.\r\n \r\nAn email was shooted to me regarding the series of dents occurred respect to VXML IVR and within the Region RWCE.

This was not a standard document and it required updates from many people and one resource was sick with a very high fever.She was a very key resource and we had aligned a back-up however considering the severity, she updated the document despite her medical condition. Post her updates, we completed the remaining updates, reviewed the document and finished up the work by 11:30PM IST such that the customer based in RASO could get their document by next day morning. This activity helped cement our place with the region and until now we have been able to have a steady working relationship with them due to the trust that was built on that day 6 months ago.\r\nI have seen all the 3 values in this experience - Professionalism shown by the resource, Respect to the customer and one another and Perseverance shown by the entire team.

When you\'re surrounded by people who share a commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible. Since am new to the EMA product I have undergone training and it was a fantastic experience how they respect my views. Initially they started with the theoretical training later on it ended up with OJT. While I am doing my OJT training ,I had to have many discussions with my teammates.teammates. Eventhough they are very busy in their scheduled tasks, gave time to me and encouraged me .It was really admirable and helped me in completing my OJT successfully  which resulted in getting my first assignment soon. I got my first project Turkcell with less duration of time , It was my first challenging task and I have completed successfully with SSAT 100%.

I used to think being Manager/teacher/Politician/scientist made them a special kind of person, but I realize that the most special thing about them was not their career, but the way they persevered.The mantel of respect always falls on those who consistently do their duty.Here is my short story which helps us understand how perseverance can help you in difficult situation.I was perform a activity of loadbalancing for 1 million subcriber from one sdp to another and I have taken complete network outage for this activity.Activity was going very smoothly until we were about to load the subcribers in the destination SDP ,I executed  the script  which loads the subscriber in the destination SDP it was around 2 AM and I have downtime only till 6 AM  in the morning thats when the script failed its execution stating with an error one of configuration dump file is missing. I tried to pull the dump again from source and tried to load it now again it gives same error.\r\n\r\nSometimes we are about to achieve our goals, but give up through lack of perseverance and patience.But I didn\'t give up I have called one my collegue for this help it was around 3 am . I  asked me create file with the name of the missing file and asked me build the dump again . Again I executed the script it throwed error. now it was 3.45 am .Now I thought about  giving up and roll back the activity but this will lead huge amount of customer escalation and credibility and the trust, which are very important values, will be lost. But my friend asked me keep it simple go by the log generated for the script execution .Then we identified the dump are getting extracted in a temporary path so we decided to place this file that temporary path.But again we the script got failed . Then we identifed that the temporary path keeps changing everytime we execute the script.So I was ready to place this immediately as soon as the script creates the temporary path. This time the script got executed successfully and I was able to complete my activity on time.So Perseverance is the drive that keeps us going even the the midst of severe trials.We all know that slow and steady wins the race, but sometimes we need a little extra encouragement to keep us going like the one i got from my friend.\r\n\r\nhere I have expressed my secret success.

During this period I have worked with many teams from Ericsson and customers globally. The Values of Ericsson that are displayed in every day at work have sinked into me so deep that they are now a part of my behavior and are displayed subtly in all parts of life whether it is personal or professional.\r\n\r\nI would like to share a story from my early career life in Ericsson when I got a first-hand experience of the Ericsson values that should be a part of you to thrive as contributor in this organization. It happened one night when My Customer Project Manager called in to describe a challenging situation that had arisen, as one of our teammate was not able to perform a Critical Subscriber Migration Activity that had been planned, due to is critical health issue. This communication came six hours before the schedule maintenance downtime window. Subscriber Migration is a Critical Activity and needs lots of planning and communication to all involved parties and service outage. This Migration was more critical as server load had been peaking and crossing service thresholds. So postponing the activity was not an option. My CPM showed belief in me and asked me if I could step-up to the challenge. Considering the criticality of the situation which challenged the credibility and trust on Ericsson for service delivery, I took this task with which my CPM had entrusted me. I had experience of this activity on a test bed but not on a production environment. But I took a calculated Risk as I believed in my knowledge and past experiences. I planned an immediate travel to customer site and started activity with caution and diligence. I was able to complete subscriber migration activity well within the maintenance window.  As customer too was aware of the situation that had arisen due to health condition of other SI, I was appreciated by both customer and CPM for standing up to the task and keeping customer success as a priority and delivering as per expectations. Customer was so satisfied that they asked for me specifically whenever there was a subscriber migration. I felt that by showing professionalism in my work I had earned customer’s respect and customer had a belief in me that I would walk an extra mile if ever a situation arises in future. \r\n\r\nI would continue to live these values (Professionalism, Respect, and Perseverance) and help others to embrace these values by leading with example because after all It begins with Us.\r\n\r\n','','','','','','',NULL,NULL,353,'ESAADAS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-15 11:56:23','Pending'),('EAGARPR','Prashant.Agarwal@ericsson.com','GURGAON','EAGAVIN','BUGS GSI MSDP-AO 4',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,354,'ESUJSIH',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 13:14:44','Pending'),('ESUMOND','subhasish.mondal@ericsson.com','Kolkata','EVENKOL','BUGS GSI EMA 1',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,355,'EPRISAR',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 13:25:20','Pending'),('EVENKUP','venkata.koundinya.kuppa@ericsson.com','Bangalore','ETHANGA','BUGS GSI CS AIR SDP VS 3',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,356,'EANRDAS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 16:51:44','Pending'),('ERAYSAU','raja.sekhar.reddy.sainikommu@ericsson.com','Chennai','ESRISET','BUGS GSI M&A Adaptn TV CA 2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,357,'EJALBAN',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 17:08:03','Pending'),('EQTWXXY','jagadeeswar.reddy.v@ericsson.com','Chennai','EARSIVA','BUGS GSI MS Cricket-ITOC','','','','There was one time when we had  a customer CR.

Before executing the Project activities especially on Production Nodes, we prepare a Plan along with CPM and then present to Customer, to make them in line with our Activities. There are many instances, when Customer showed concerns with many queries when we asked them for the approval for activities, we always worked towards providing the good technical justification to make them satisfied with answers and agreed for our activities. \r\nEvery week, we used to discuss the Project schedule with CPM to check where we are in achieving our timelines?

Initially I had to spend day and night (15-16 hr a day) for months as half of team members were working in dayshift and half in night, so I had to be in sync with both teams (Gurgaon & Mysore) to guiding and monitoring their activities.

Trousers, full sleeve shirt, shiny leather shoe, matching tie and belt. This is a proven model and most seem to be OK with it.\r\n\r\nEricsson defies that tradition by allowing an individual to dress based on his own taste and comfort. At first it seems to be a subtle difference separating us from others. But thinking more into it reveals a fundamental difference in our outlook and attitude. It defines who we are and what we do.\r\n\r\nOur organization is built on three fundamental qualities ... Professionalism, Respect and Perseverance. And these are the qualities that we strive for and implement on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nProfessionalism: At Ericsson priority is giving our 100% to the task assigned to us and getting the best out of an individual. And Ericsson is committed to provide an environment where its employee can concentrate solely on the task assigned. And unless the role demands formal etiquette, it is about putting the needs of our clients first and getting the job done rather than just looking serious.\r\n\r\nRespect : It is easier to manage people by providing a single set of rules to follow. But this limits our creativity. Because as an individual, we all are different with our our own taste and comfort zone. Ericsson treats its employees as an individual. We are given the freedom to express ourselves in our own way. As a result we are not purely a dull set of gray and white. Rather we collectively represent a wide spectrum of vibrant colors.\r\n\r\nPerseverance : Trying new idea is one thing. Sticking to it and delivering good result everyday is different. People say being casual is a slow process of giving up. But here we prove it wrong everyday. Defying the contemporary is the way of life here. No giving up until we get the job done.

If you say yes - I bet you got it wrong!\r\nSurprisingly…Automation is totally about people!! \r\nHow good they feel with the system doing things? \r\nHow much they believe that it eases their daily chores?\r\nHow much positive impact did it leave on their efficiency increase? \r\nIn one statement - HOW SATISFIED IS YOUR WORKFORCE?!!!\r\nRings a bell?? Yes exactly - these organizations tagged automation success to DIALOG Survey results from their field force - Dispatchers and the Field Technicians!\r\nWe might think we implemented great solution and automation numbers have roared high up! but FSO users have to \"experience\" the goodness and it must reflect in DIALOG survey. This was the goal set by the local organizations - which best explains how much Ericsson values its employees and “RESPECTS” their behavior towards system and organization changes.\r\nAligning technical project goals with DIALOG survey results was the toughest challenge for the automation team.\r\nWe have to hold on tight to our course of action, believe and make people believe that the technical changes we implemented will ease their current WOW and stick to our goal patiently....because at the end of the day we RESPECT the end users and foresee for their comfort with changes.\r\nBoth projects were executed for more than a year with lots of criticism and constant system tuning and yes - of course at the end.. People of the field service organization gave accolades to our work when they experienced efficiency in all perspectives! That was the success earned by our program!!\r\n\r\nMiracles need not happen!

I landed at Douala, thoroughly amazed by its natural beauty.  I  got a go ahead from the client for the activity. As things were to turn out, the activity did not progress and the upgrade  was showing an error.  No way to steer clear.  The question ‘what could be the issue?’ was haunting me. The time-slot got over and the activity was declared as failed. Obviously, the client was disappointed. The local Ericsson there had enough reasons to raise hue and cry due to the likely implications on their future activities.  Some colleagues of mine had also their own share of doubts on my compliance. Though I too nurtured  doubts on the compliance level, I double-checked and found that to be fine at my end.  It was decided to raise a  CSR.  The PDU after investigations suggested a way forward.  I moved all  the traffic and tried the procedure on other node.  Alas, it miserably failed.  The PDU was subsequently requested for a better solution.  In the meanwhile, I realized  that the causative reason for the flop could be  “ not meeting the requirement of storage for DDS”  in view of the huge amount of  data to be generated.  Though the  client was not ready initially,   they  conceded later. I  could make the initial lead but on the final run-up,  the procedure failed. The client was deservedly annoyed. They opined that their production system was being used as a  test system  resulting in huge cost escalations.  Finally PDU raised a ticket with SUN (now Solaris) and  in a span of time they gave us a patch to be installed during upgrade. This time, despite being nervous-ridden,  I ventured upon and the activity proceeded without any hitch  and the mission achieved success. I was damn happy !!  \r\n\r\nAnother opportunity for similar activity in Digicel Martinique. Though things were going fine until  90% level; due to some issues  the downtime exhausted. The client was not receptive for one hour extension and  insisted for  rollback. Though fuming inside,  I had to comply with the client’s wishes.  The roll back  too had  unexpected hitches.   With  the back-up,  2 emergency CSRs, 48 hrs of non-stop efforts and an empty stomach,  the system was rolled back.  Me and the client heaved a sigh of relief. Subsequently when I was in another country for on-site, a colleague of mine who was entrusted with  re-doing the failed activity in Digicel Martinique was on a tele-conference with me for hours to resolve the issue as his attempts too failed.  Pooling of inputs of both of us made the activity to finally take-off.  He, me and our Mentor Ericsson succeeded.

So, first day of working late and I had to book a cab through facilities team and as per the policy, facilities team clubs cab for people on the same route or nearby drops. In my case, however, due to some misunderstanding, I was put in a shared cab with 3 other employees. However, for other 3 employees drop points were completely off-route my destination and it was only after we had covered some distance that I realized this problem. So, rather than distrurb those 3 employees and get them late, we decided that after they are dropped, I will get last drop. But since this was a lot of inconvenience for me and got very late reaching home, next day I conveyed the same to facilities team. As a result, there was an immediate action from the facilities team and they accepted the fault on their part and told me that for all the subsequent late evening cabs they would ensure cabs are corrrectly mapped. So, the facilities team handled this very professionaly and also respected the fact that  how much trouble it caused me. They could have just ignored this complaint of mine  and simply could have told me that this was the only cab available, but they handled the situation very professionally. Infact next day, after I booked fro the late evening cab, I also received a confirmation call to check if I am in the right cab and also if a security guard was accompanying. So, I really appreciate the fact that our core values are followed not only by us for our customers, but also internal teams follow and thoroughly implement them for us as well.

But somehow made my mind and pressed the green button to answer the call, this call was from MSDP Incident manager. Incident Manager explained me the problem and told me that the Digicel customer is facing critical problem with OneFM and not able to monitor some specific alarms and some alarms showing in OneFM WbeGUI after delay 7minutes from SO-EM EMS. He asked me to join Bridge and Lync session to resolve the issue immediately. I listened to the problem, told him about my situation. It was not possible for me to make myself available online at that moment. I gave alternative solution to Incident Manager till the time myself available online. Incident manager agreed with the solution and respected my opinion. This made me bit relaxed to attend the function.  I reached my house at 10.30PM after attending the family function. In hurry, I switched on my LAPTOP and joined the telephone Bridge. Consolidated the data from Operations team, GNOC team and Back Office team and started my investigation on production system by collecting various logfiles, packet captures etc. Then I have requested the information from back office team over call and Lync session. It was bit hard to get the information from SO-EM system as admin was not available onsite. Incident Manager has put all his effort to get the SO-EM Admin resource to get me the required information. After log waiting, I got the required alarm information from EMS Admin. I verified all OneFM details with SO-EM alarm dump shared by administrator. My luck, I found very important information in the SO-EM log file, it confirmed me that the Event time in alarm was delayed by 7 minutes in EMS Element Management System itself and some alarms were not sending proper alarm details. it was 6.00AM IST, sun was just raising and birds were waking up with their melodious sound. On Bridge Incident Manager requested the SO-EM admin to confirm on the issue at SO-EM end. Admin verified from his side and confirmed that the issue is at EMS end. EMS server time was configured with 7 minutes delay and that was causing this problem. And some transmission nodes were running with very old software which was causing missing information in the alarm.  Then I have explained the whole story to GNOC with proofs like logfiles and screenshots. GNOC got convinced and agreed to make the Ticket status from critical to RESOLVED. Finally the issue got resolved with activity assigned to EMS Admin to resolve the issue at SO-EM end. By now, it was 7.00AM Indian time.

It has been 5 years since I have been a part of the Ericsson family and every bit of my duration of stay in this organization has helped me build upon the three values, rather the three pillars of Ericsson\'s success story. Professionalism, Respect and Perseverance... these are not mere words, we the employees of Ericsson, live by these values and I feel it in all my actions.\r\n\r\nProfessionalism, which means putting customer first in any scenario, is a core value practiced at each location and instance. Delivering an assignment is not just enough in terms of professionalism, there needs to be more. Our customers need to be the apostles or band ambassadors for our service quality to the rest of the world. Ericsson had always been a leader in terms of delivering customer excellence in all its services. Our key objective is to provide not only customer satisfaction but customer delight. This is professionalism redefined!\r\n\r\nRespect, the value which enables Ericsson employees to innovate and make decisions faster, has definitely helped me learn and grow in my career graph. I have not only gained respect from my colleagues and customers but also learned and practiced the value myself. This grooms me as both an individual as well as professional.\r\nI started working with Ericsson in 2010, and was with D&P UPE. Then, I moved from EIL to EGI. For this, my manager and the entire team supported me in my decision and their respect and confidence helped me to take the next step in my career. I have recently moved to CSI, this is an innovative step and a learning process for me where I am molding my career, innovating and generating solution for my customers in every assignment that I am taking up. All thanks to my Eric family.\r\n\r\nThe third pillar of success for Ericsson and me as an employee is Perseverance. Constant improvement and no Complacence, is the key to growth and improving standards of work. I as an employee of Ericsson, feel that in spite of all the technical challenges which prop up every now and then, I and my team have never given up in terms of efforts and constant improvement in terms of our service quality. I have always tried to walk an extra mile and achieve what is better than the best for our clients. I do not believe in being complacent, as it stagnates your thought process and kills your growth and quest for knowledge. \r\n\r\nIt is not only my personal experiences which make me say that the three values are pillars of success for Ericsson, I see the success story of every leader at Ericsson as a saga based on these three values. It is instilled in the regular activities of all the employees of Ericsson. This is helping the organization achieve greater heights with each passing day. I would like to further state that these values not only make Ericsson stand out in the huge gamut of service sector organizations, but if imbibed will make an individual also stand out as a star prof','','','','','','',NULL,NULL,475,'ECHAARU',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-15 19:42:52','Pending'),('EPRUVXA','arun.kumar.s@ericsson.com','Guindy Chennai','EBPBPBP','BUGS GSI CS AIR SDP VS 5','In Ericsson professional workplace behavior plays a vital role in long-term success of a business.

What do you think?\r\nI always calibrate my own success/achievements based on how much I have contributed towards these values; this is applicable to both my professional and personal life.\r\nI just want to share; I just want to recap my 3 years of project journey with Ericsson values, oops!! Sorry the value of life. \r\nHere you go “The Story of 100\'s\"\r\nMy journey with Ericsson started in the year 2012.\r\nRight from the start I got the opportunity to work with customers from different regions (RINA,RMEA,RASO,RMED,RSSA ) directly ,they differ by time,climate,culture,language and work nature. Few are easy to handle and some are difficult to convince. So I always set my mind flat and flexible so  it helps me to adapt/adjust for any situations.\r\nTo handle a customer first you should adhere to Ericsson values apart from this you should be confident, a good listener and talkative. Yes of course as a professional we should have these qualities by default and I strongly feel I have learned these skills from all my projects and I keep developing it. \r\nProfessionalism:\r\nProfessionalism is being punctual. When I was working for Batelco Bahrain, I use to work from customer office every day, their working time starts at 7 AM where I use to reach customer office ahead to maintain the high degree of professional punctuality and this was appreciated by customer.\r\nProfessionalism is taking responsibilities. In Mcel Mozambique, the project doesn’t have solution architect. Even though I was assigned as a SI, understanding the situation I took the SA responsibility to fulfill my project requirement to avoid delay in delivery. \r\nProfessionalism is satisfying customer commitments. Recently in Algeria in spite of being assigned for Djezzy project I have asked for emergency support to upgrade 7 CCN’ in 9 days for ooredoo. I have delivered on-time without any issue.\r\nRespect:\r\nI always prefer to stay at customer location .I have done that at all the times for customers like Batelco, Djezzy, Mcel and Airtel to hear from them all the time. Since listening to customer is the biggest respect you offer them. \r\nI always respect their timelines and wait for their unanswered emails.\r\nI always prefer to have fair relation with customer, few customers talk beyond work still I listen to make them comfortable. \r\nPerseverance:\r\nI have maintained high standard of delivery on 10 projects which I have handled so far in Ericsson which includes 5 different regions with more than 8 different customers with total of 10 consecutive 100% SSAT.  \r\nI have received appreciation directly from customers like Djezzy, Mcel, Batelco, Airtel, and GrameenPhone. And I have delivered complex projects with different scope of works.\r\nRecently I have received Fast and Flawless award for Airtel Bangladesh MBC project.

My phone rang...my brother in law called me up...I got tensed and worried because He never calls me in morning or even in noon time.\r\nI picked up the phone, before I could say Hello!!! I heard his voice \"Jija Ji (Me) Please Save Papa...He has got heart attack.\" He was crying loud.\" I could hear the voice of my Wife, She also was crying loud (that time She was expecting and went Varanasi to meet her Father and Bother.\r\nI could not say anything...i become numb because it was my first experience like this.. I never handled such situation ...I was literally shivering. I tried to console them that do not worry He will be fine. He disconnected the phone. I booked the next available flight immediately which was at 11:30. Since critical deliveries were planned I had to manage my work as well, I opened my Laptop and first mail I sent to my Manager, stating him the situation. I messaged to my whole team that I won’t be able to come to office. I prepared the list of task to be carried out for next 1 week and shared with the team. I mailed each and every information to my backup Sheetu with each and every minor detail. \r\nAt 7:43 AM, I got a call from my Father that my Father in laws has passed away.

I could not say no. But my work at office...how that would be done!!! So I called my Manager Sankar Ganesh and asked his permission to Stay.

We were a group of 12-15 engineers (recently joined CSI-ADM) who were working on their first project in E// .For many, it was the first experience with any E// product. We all were very enthusiastic to work on a project, but we very little knew that it was going to be an everest climbing task with lots of expectations, hard-work, sleepless nights and full of coordination. We started this journey together, trying to build a bonding, harvesting a culture to help each other and helping each other learn. Days moved on, weeks passed by, one after the other SDP\'s got installed , but all of a sudden, we got a push from CPM to get around 25 SDP\'s installed and made live within 30 days time (march-2015) . The CPM knew it was not an easy task, but he made us believe in ourselves and respect the customer need.\r\n\r\nFinally, We all together made E// proud in front of the customer after long tiring days and sleepless nights, sharing the work load among ourselves and made all the SDP\'s live with 5 days to spare (from the dead line).\r\n\r\nThis work was well appreciated by the customer and CPM. Each of us was happy that we could live upto our own expectations, we each could have helped E// build a reputation of Fast and Flawless delivery and most importantly demonstrate the spirit of team work together.\r\n\r\nThis is what I call success!. A true success story, where we could live upto expectations (even better it), create a culture, build a fruitfull relationship with customer and most importantly, identify our own strengths.\r\n\r\nI personally would like to wish all of my team members best of luck and would really love to work with them in future.','','','','','','',NULL,NULL,483,'ESAADAS',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-18 11:46:15','Pending'),('ESMAMNK','mayank.a.sharma@ericsson.com','BANGALORE','EKMNPQS','BUGS GSI ADM&TAAS&TAAS3','','','','Getting first professional job feels like a big leap into the real world.

Well, I believe, these are not only ‘Ericsson’s’ core values, these are the building blocks of a successful, yet humble human being. \r\nRespect is the very essence of our personality that’s imbibed in us right from our birth and matures as we grow up. It’s not only how we handle our customers or managers in office or elders at home, it’s also how we handle and groom our team at office and kids at home. Respect is something that is mutual- It’s not a one way street. There’s an age old saying- ‘You have to earn respect’.  Well I would like to differ on that. Respect is something people surrounding you will themselves sense -You don’t have to do anything special to ‘earn’ it. \r\nIt’s simple- the moment you see your ideal colleague fighting, shouting and abusing in middle of the road – you lose all the respect you had for him, gathered from years of interaction. \r\nPerseverance is a CHOICE that you yourself make for your growth and success. It is something that doesn’t let you fail in life when you fail in one chapter! It is something that gets you up every morning no matter how tired you are and brings you to work. Perseverance is something that can surpass intelligence. Perseverance is an ATTITUDE that never lets you quit anything. Perseverance alone can get you ahead in life. \r\nAfter all, perseverance is something that gave is Bulb!!\r\nProfessionalism is a quality that I believe an organization inculcates in you. You learn it and you take it from others. You are not taught about this in schools, you can’t be taught this at home. It’s single and most important value that only a work culture can groom in you. Ericsson demonstrates and feeds this in you so strongly that even when you move out, you take it with you- It’s with you for life!

Your plan is your roadmap to your desired destination. Simply without one you\'ll deviate.\r\nBefore you start your pursuit of a goal, make a commitment to yourself that you will work towards it for a specific period of time and won\'t give up before that time arrives. Make this period as long or as short as you want but the important thing is not to quit before the allotted time.\r\nSelf-control is a must when developing perseverance in daily life. Exercising self-control ensures you remain focused on the task or tasks in hand, and not get side-tracked and distracted.\r\nEstablish consistent daily habits. Take small steps of progress consistently everyday will mean that your efforts will compound and success will be inevitable.\r\nThe importance of perseverance in life cannot be stressed enough.

I would like to share an incident during one of my visit to Cuba which showcases living the core values of Ericsson viz Professionalism, Perseverance and Respect. \r\nAs part of safety and security I register myself with the Indian Embassy whenever I visit any country and I did the same in Cuba. One day I got a call from the Indian Embassy and they contacted stating they had an issue with their Hughes Satellite internet switch at the Ambassador’s residence. Since I was registered as Engineer and working for Ericsson they were wondering if I can fix it for them. Cuba being embargo country procuring a new switch will cost money and time. \r\nI showed great Respect to their request and visited the Ambassador’s residence to understand the problem they have. To me this situation is like facing a customer and I took up the challenge in a Professional manner and asked them if they can give the switch to analyze and troubleshoot. \r\nThe local technician who had inspected the switch earlier had given a final report as this is completely damaged and cannot be rectified. \r\nWith no internet connection available readily, finding any troubleshooting references was impossible. The only way was to open the switch to check for any faulty part. Language being a constraint, with great difficulty I was able to procure a toolkit somehow from the Hotel technician. Split opened the switch with the available tools, and inspected thoroughly. It seemed one of the component in the switch was damaged and replacement might bring back the switch in running condition. \r\nTo get this part in a country where Spanish is the official language was a challenge. The Perseverance to find a solution drove me to the local shops with some help and was able to secure the required part. The part was replaced and the switch’s LED indicators starter glowing which was dead earlier. Took the switch to the Ambassador’ residence and connected it to check. It was a proud moment when the switch started working perfectly fine and Internet was getting accessed. The Ambassador was very happy with my work and considered me as part of the their family which gave me a feeling of home away from home.\r\nI approached this as if I work for Ericsson customer and I was able to live our core values of Professionalism, Perseverance & Respect to solve the problem. \r\nThe Respectable moment was when I was invited for a dinner party at the Indian Ambassador’s residence along with Ambassadors from Russian, Japanese and Mexican Embassies. I was introduced to the Dignitaries as an Ericsson employee from India working on project in cuba for telecom operator ETECSA.
